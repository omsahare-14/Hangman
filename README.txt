Two or more players can participate in the guessing game of hangman. A player comes up with a word, phrase, or sentence, and the other(s) try to guess it by offering letters within a set number of guesses.
A row of dashes, one for each letter of the word, is used to indicate the word to be predicted. Proper nouns, such as names, locations, companies, or slang, may be allowed or prohibited by rules. The other player writes the letter in all of its proper placements if the person who is guessing offers a letter that appears in the word. One component of a hanged stick figure is drawn by the opposing player as a tally mark if the recommended letter does not appear in the word.
The person making the guess may try to guess the entire word at any point. The guesser wins if their guess is right, which ends the game. If not, the opposing player may decide to punish the guesser by including a new element in the diagram. On the other side, the guesser loses if they guess incorrectly enough for the opponent to finish the diagram. However, the guesser can also succeed by correctly predicting every letter in the word before the graphic is finished, thereby completing the word.
